## 🔹 What the App Does

The NEXARIS Cognitive Load Estimator (NCLE) is a sophisticated desktop application designed to estimate a user's cognitive load in real-time. It achieves this by intelligently integrating and analyzing data from multiple sources:

*   **Task Performance**: Monitors how a user performs on specific tasks.
*   **Behavioral Patterns**: Tracks mouse movements, clicks, and keyboard inputs.
*   **Facial Emotion Analysis**: Utilizes a webcam to detect faces and recognize emotional cues.

This comprehensive approach provides a nuanced understanding of user engagement, stress levels, and overall cognitive state during computer-based activities. The application features a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) for ease of operation and real-time feedback.

## 🛠️ How to Install

Follow these steps to get NCLE up and running on your system:

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    *   Python 3.7 or newer.
    *   A webcam (required for the facial analysis feature).
    *   Git (for cloning the repository).

2.  **Clone the Repository**:
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/devartix0aymane/NEXARIS-CLE.git # Replace with your actual repository URL if different
    cd NEXARIS-CLE
    ```

3.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**:
    This helps manage project dependencies and avoid conflicts.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    Activate the environment:
    *   **Windows**: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    *   **macOS/Linux**: `source venv/bin/activate`

4.  **Install Dependencies**:
    With the virtual environment activated, install the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: `opencv-python` can sometimes have complex dependencies. If you encounter installation issues, you might need to install additional system-level libraries or try a specific version compatible with your OS.*

## ▶️ How to Run

Once the installation is complete, you can launch the NCLE application by running the main script from the project's root directory:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

## 🧠 Technologies Used

NCLE leverages a stack of powerful Python libraries and technologies:

*   **Core Language**: Python 3
*   **GUI Framework**: PyQt5 / PySide2 (or other, specify if known, e.g., Tkinter)
*   **Computer Vision**: OpenCV (`opencv-python`) for webcam access, face detection, and image processing.
*   **Data Analysis/Numerics**: NumPy, Pandas (if used for data manipulation)
*   **System Monitoring**: `psutil` for CPU usage monitoring.
*   **Behavioral Tracking**: Libraries like `pynput` or custom implementations for mouse/keyboard tracking.
*   **Emotion Recognition**: Potentially custom models or libraries like `deepface`, `fer` (specify if known).
*   **Data Logging**: Standard Python CSV module.
*   **Configuration**: `QSettings` (from PyQt) or JSON/YAML files.

## 🧩 How it Fits into the NEXARIS Architecture

NCLE is envisioned as a key component within the broader **NEXARIS Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) & Cognitive Analytics Platform**. Its role is to provide granular, real-time data on user cognitive states.

*   **Data Source**: NCLE acts as a primary data acquisition module, capturing rich multimodal data (behavioral, physiological via webcam, task-related) from individual user sessions.
*   **Local Processing**: It performs initial processing and feature extraction locally to derive cognitive load metrics.
*   **API Integration (Future)**: The processed data and cognitive load estimations can be streamed or batched to a central NEXARIS data lake or analytics engine via a secure API. This allows for:
    *   Aggregated analysis across multiple users and sessions.
    *   Longitudinal tracking of cognitive states.
    *   Training more advanced global models for cognitive load prediction and user adaptation.
*   **Feedback Loop**: Insights from the central NEXARIS platform could, in turn, inform NCLE's configuration or task adaptation strategies, creating a closed-loop system for optimizing user experience and performance.
*   **Modular Component**: Designed with modularity, NCLE can be integrated as a standalone sensor or alongside other NEXARIS modules (e.g., physiological sensors, advanced AI recommenders).

## 🚀 Upgrade Plan: SUPER MODE

**SUPER MODE** represents the next evolution of NCLE, aiming for significantly enhanced capabilities and a more immersive user experience. Key features planned for SUPER MODE include:

1.  **Advanced AI Models**: 
    *   Transition from rule-based or simpler models to deep learning architectures for emotion recognition and cognitive load prediction (e.g., using LSTMs, Transformers for temporal data).
    *   Personalized models that adapt to individual user baselines and response patterns.
2.  **EEG Integration (Optional Module)**:
    *   Seamless integration with consumer-grade EEG headsets (e.g., Muse, Emotiv) to incorporate neural signals for more direct cognitive state assessment.
    *   Real-time EEG feature extraction (e.g., band power, event-related potentials).
3.  **Enhanced Multimodal Fusion**: 
    *   Sophisticated algorithms for fusing data from webcam, behavior, task performance, and EEG (if available) to produce a more robust and accurate cognitive load index.
4.  **Adaptive Interfaces**: 
    *   The system could dynamically adjust task difficulty, UI elements, or provide timely interventions based on the estimated cognitive load (e.g., suggesting breaks, simplifying tasks).
5.  **Real-time Biofeedback**: 
    *   Visual or auditory feedback to the user about their current cognitive state, potentially helping them manage stress or focus.
6.  **Cloud Connectivity & Analytics Dashboard**: 
    *   Securely sync data to a cloud platform for advanced analytics, trend visualization, and comparison across users/groups (tying into the broader NEXARIS platform).
    *   A web-based dashboard for researchers or administrators to review aggregated data.
7.  **Gamification & Engagement**: 
    *   Introduce gamified elements to make tasks more engaging and to motivate users.
8.  **Contextual Awareness**: 
    *   Attempt to understand the broader context of the user's activity (e.g., type of application being used) to refine cognitive load estimation.

SUPER MODE aims to transform NCLE from an estimator into a proactive cognitive assistant.
